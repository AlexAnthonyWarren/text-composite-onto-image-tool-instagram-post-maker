run.py:
	run.py is the program you should launch to start the program.

py_lib_check.bat:
	This is a handy file I wrote that means you dont need to mess around in cmd.
	This is executed from run.py on launch (so dont worry about it).

data.txt:
	Data is where you paste all the quotes you want to make into posts. 
	This file will wipe after every time you run.py.
	Make sure it is formatted as below in the data.txt:

Hello, this is quote 1.
This is quote 2.
This is quote 3.
This is quote 4....

./images/:
	Images is where you store all the images you want run.py to use for rendering your image.
	Images used HAVE to be ".jpg"/".jpeg".
	Square images look better with scaling.

./exports/:
	Is where you will find all the exported images.
